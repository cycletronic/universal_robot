1. Consider the case where padding is added to each object in the enviorment such that the planned trajectory keeps a safe distance from each object.
2. If the starting point is determined to be in collision while the actual robot is not (collision detected in the padding), how can we move safely away from the "colliding object"?
3. Implement a solution for the above senario and create tests to verify it.
4. Create a document discribing how it works and how to verify it with the test.
