1. Consider the case where padding is added to each object in the enviorment such that the planned trajectory keeps a safe distance from each object.
2. If the starting point is determined to be in collision while the actual robot is not (collision detected in the padding), how can we move safely away from the "colliding object"?

  Algorithm Idea:
   1. Randomly sample with N samples in joint configuration space, centered on the initial pose, starting with large variation.
   2. Identify the sampled pose that is nearest to the initial pose and also completely free of collisions.
   3. Randomly sample N poses again, centered on the best pose, but with smaller variation (controlled by a learning rate parameter)
   4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the best pose changes only a little between iterations.
   5. Create motion plan from initial state to best candidate state, temporarily reducing or disabling the collision padding to execute the plan.

3. Implement a solution for the above senario and create tests to verify it.
4. Create a document discribing how it works and how to verify it with the test.
